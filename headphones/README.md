Project Overview

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

Requirements

you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript.

Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesnâ€™t have the fonts used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
